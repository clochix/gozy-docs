## How does it work?

A connector is a NodeJS script.
+The target node version used to run your connector is the version 8.

Like client side apps, connectors communicate with the [Cozy Stack](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/README/) using its HTTP API, and get a unique auth token every time they start.

They need to register with a [manifest](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-apps-registry/#properties-meaning-reference), and ask the user for permissions.

To facilitate connector development, a npm package, [cozy-konnector-libs](https://github.com/konnectors/libs), provides some shared libraries that are adapted to be used for a connector:

 - [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org) to easily query a HTML page
 - [request-promise](https://github.com/request/request-promise): [request](https://github.com/request/request) with Promise support
 - [request-debug](https://github.com/request/request-debug) that displays all the requests and responses in the standard output.
   Toggle _debug_ option in [requestFactory options](https://github.com/konnectors/libs/blob/master/packages/cozy-konnector-libs/docs/api.md#module_requestFactory)

Besides, you'll probably need some other npm packages to help you run your connector:

 - [momentjs](http://momentjs.com/docs/) or [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) to manage dates
 - [bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com) to get enhanced promises

When the connector is started, it also receives some data via environment variables:

 - `COZY_CREDENTIALS`: an auth token used by [cozy-client-js][] to communicate with the server
 - `COZY_URL`: the Cozy Stack API entry point
 - `COZY_FIELDS`: settings coming from [Cozy Home][] and filled by the user (login, password, directory path).

These variables are used by the connector and the cozy-client to configure the connection to the [Cozy Stack][] with the right [permissions](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/permissions/) as defined in the connector [manifest](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-apps-registry/#properties-meaning-reference).
They are simulated in standalone mode so that you do not need a real Cozy Stack to develop a connector.

From the server point of view, each connector is a `job` which is executed periodically via a `trigger`.
